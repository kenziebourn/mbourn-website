          My name is McKenzie Bourn. I am currently a third-year computer science student at Oregon State University 
          who loves to explore cutting-edge technologies that shape our world. As I work towards my degree, 
          I am seeking internship opportunities in frontend, backend or full-stack development. I am eager to contribute my knowledge 
          and creativity to real-world projects in order to grow as a technical professional.
        </p>

        Beyond work, you'll often find me on the tennis court, playing Billiards, or cooking
        various Asian cuisines. But that's not allâ€”I have a passion for travel and exploration. In March 2023, I embarked 
        on my first solo trip to Mexico, embracing new experiences and immersing myself in diverse cultures.
        To me, life is an adventure, and I'm always up for a challenge.
